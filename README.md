# Telecom Churn & CLV

## Project Goal
Predict telecom customer churn and quantify business impact by combining churn probability with Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).  
The goal is not only to predict who will churn, but which churners matter most for profit.

---

# 1. Business Context

Telecom churn is typically 20–30% per year.  
But not all churn is equally damaging:

- Losing a *Low CLV* user has small financial impact
- Losing a *Top CLV* user significantly affects profit  

This project solves that by combining:

**Churn Prediction**  
**CLV Segmentation**  
**High‑value retention targeting**  

---

# 2. Data Description

Dataset: Public “Telco Customer Churn” dataset (~7,000 customers).  
Includes demographics, service usage, contract type, billing method, charges, and churn flag.

### Key fields used:
`gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`,  
`InternetService`, `Contract`, `PaymentMethod`,  
`MonthlyCharges`, `tenure`, `Churn`,  
and many value‑added service indicators.

---

# 3. Methods & Pipeline

## 3.1 Data Cleaning
- Convert `TotalCharges` to numeric  
- Remove invalid rows  
- Standardize categorical labels  
- Create binary churn target: ChurnFlag

## 3.2 Feature Engineering (Business-Aligned)
| Feature | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **ServicesCount** | Measures stickiness: more services = lower churn |
| **HasFiber** | Fiber users often have higher expectations; track separately |
| **IsMonthToMonth** | Main churn driver; structural instability |
| **IsElectronicCheck** | Known risky billing method |
| **CLV_realized** | Revenue × tenure |
| **CLV_realized_margin** | Adds profitability meaning |
| **CLV_segment** | Groups customers into Low–Top |

## 3.3 Modeling Approach
Two models optimized and compared:

### Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable)  
### Random Forest (nonlinear, higher variance)

Both models used:

- Train/test split  
- One-hot encoding  
- ROC AUC evaluation  
- Feature importance analysis  

---

# 4. Model Results & Comparison

## 4.1 Logistic Regression – Results

**Accuracy:** 0.81  
**ROC AUC:** 0.838  
**Recall (churners):** 0.58  
**Precision (churners):** 0.66  

### Why Logistic Regression Performs Well
- Relationships between churn & features are mostly linear and interpretable.  
- Contract type, payment method, tenure explain churn clearly with monotonic patterns.  
- The engineered features (IsMonthToMonth, HasFiber, ServicesCount) align very well with linear coefficients.

### What It Means
This model is reliable for:
- Understanding why customers churn  
- Designing retention strategies  
- Explaining results to marketing leaders  

---

## 4.2 Random Forest – Results

**Accuracy:** 0.77  
**ROC AUC:** 0.831  
**Recall (churners):** 0.72  
**Precision (churners):** 0.54  

### Why Random Forest Underperformed Slightly
- Dataset is relatively small (~7k rows), forests benefit more from large datasets.  
- Signal to noise ratio is high → linear model is sufficient.  
- Many features are correlated (e.g., HasFiber & InternetService_Fiber) → forests struggle.  
- Churn behavior is structural , not random → LR captures structure better.

### What It Means
RF is great at recall (captures more churners), but:
- Lower precision = more false positives  
- Less interpretable  

---

## 4.3 Model Comparison Summary

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Strength |
|-------|----------|------|----------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.81 | **0.838** | Interpretable, stable |
| **Random Forest** | 0.77 | 0.831 | Higher recall but more noise |

**Winner: Logistic Regression** (better AUC, more actionable)

# 5. Churn Drivers – What Causes Churn?

## 5.1 Top Drivers from Logistic Regression

### Increases Churn Risk
- **Month-to-month contract**  
- **Fiber users** (sensitive to quality & pricing)  
- **Electronic check payment**  
- **Streaming services active**  
- **Multiple lines** (price-sensitive families)

### Reduces Churn
- **Two-year contract**  
- **OnlineSecurity**  
- **TechSupport**  

This creates highly actionable levers for marketing, CX, and product teams.

---

# 6. High-Value At-Risk Customers

### Criteria:
- Churn probability ≥ **0.6**  
- CLV segment ∈ **High / Top**

### Result:
**61 customers** fall into this high-risk/high-value category.

These customers represent the **most important group** for retention.

---

# 7. Financial Impact Analysis

Assuming:
- Retention campaign effectiveness = 20%
- Using margin adjusted CLV

### Estimated Profit Saved:
# **€15,971**

This shows how data driven targeting generates measurable financial value.

---

# 8. Marketing Recommendations (Expanded & Strategic)

## 8.1 Contract Migration Program  
**Goal:** Reduce churn among month-to-month users (strongest churn driver).  
**Actions:**  
- Offer **12/24‑month discounts**, loyalty price locks  
- Bundle services with long-term contract (e.g., tech support included)  
- Provide “stay rewards” for commitment  

**Expected impact:**  
30-40% churn reduction in this segment.

---

## 8.2 Fiber Customer Experience Improvement  
Fiber customers show elevated churn due to:

- Installation issues  
- Competitive offers in fiber markets  
- High performance expectations  

**Actions:**  
- Proactive quality checks  
- 24h installation follow up  
- Dedicated fiber quality support line  
- VIP fiber loyalty benefits  

---

## 8.3 Value-Added Service Bundling
Because VAS (tech support, security) reduce churn:

**Actions:**
- Bundle VAS into new contract offers  
- Create “home protection” or “family bundle” packages  
- Offer 3-month free trials for VAS services  
- Add streaming bundles to reduce OTT substitution risk  

---

## 8.4 Early-Life Churn Reduction (first 60-90 days)
Customers with low tenure churn the most.

**Actions:**  
- Welcome onboarding emails  
- “First 30 days check-in”  
- Tutorials for modem setup & troubleshooting  
- Free temporary upgrades in first month  

---

## 8.5 Improve Digital Engagement
Paperless billing users churn more.

Reasons:
- Low engagement  
- Fewer touchpoints  
- More anonymous relationship  

**Actions:**
- Personalized app notifications  
- Reward points for digital interactions  
- New “digital only loyalty program”  
- Goal: increase emotional engagement  

---

## 8.6 Precision Targeting for High CLV Customers
Focus retention budget where value at risk is highest:

**Target signals:**
- High churn probability  
- High CLV  
- Low services count  
- Month-to-month contract  

**Actions:**
- Personalized outbound campaigns  
- Dedicated retention agent  
- High value loyalty perks  

---

# 9. How to Improve the Models Further

### Try XGBoost or LightGBM  
Often delivers AUC > 0.88 on this dataset.

### Hyperparameter tuning  
Grid search / randomized search.

### Create deeper behavioral features  
- Contract age  
- Price increases  
- Support call records (if available)  
- Competitor availability in region  

### SMOTE  
To handle churn class imbalance.

### Calibrate probabilities  
For more reliable retention budget allocation.
